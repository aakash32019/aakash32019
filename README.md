## About me

### VPN Infrastructure 🧰

I am currently working on maintaining a secure VPN infrastructure. This project involves configuring and managing VPN servers, implementing robust encryption protocols, and ensuring reliable connectivity for remote access.

### Client App Release 🧰

Another major focus is the release of a client application. This involves software development, testing, and deployment processes. I am responsible for managing the release cycle, addressing bugs, and ensuring a seamless user experience.

### Learning GitHub 🧠

As part of my professional development, I am actively learning GitHub, a powerful version control and collaboration platform. This valuable tool enables efficient code management, team collaboration, and project tracking.

### MSc in Project Management 👨‍🎓

In addition to my technical pursuits, I am currently pursuing a Master of Science degree in Project Management. This academic endeavor equips me with advanced knowledge and skills in project planning, risk management, resource allocation, and stakeholder engagement.

### Personal Interests

When I'm not immersed in coding or studying, I enjoy outdoor activities like going for walks 🚶 and cycling 🚲. These activities help me maintain a healthy work-life balance and recharge my mind.
